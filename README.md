# ChooseBot
### My discord bot ChooseBot
This is my discord bot, ChooseBot. You may use the code in your own projects, the language is Node.Js and I'm using Discord.Js for it. 
If you don't mind, just add a comment to your own code with my github link and my name if you do use it.
Also, you can vote for my bot [`here`](https://vote.choosethis.org) and invite it [`here`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=816457112804261908&scope=bot&permissions=1882582134)!
You will need to install the following packages in your codes terminal to have everything work properly, using "[`npm i PACKAGE-NAME`](https://www.npmjs.com/)"
Also, the packager files are availible if you need them! You should be able to download everything and then make your own `.env` file and everything should work fine!
